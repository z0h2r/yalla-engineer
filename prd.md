The ROI engineer - PRD

# 🧠 PRD – The ROI Engineer Blog Platform

## ✨ Product Title

**The ROI Engineer**  
_A pragmatic software engineering blog on maximizing time, energy, and impact._

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Software engineers often consume large amounts of content but fail to synthesize or reflect on what they've learned. There’s a need for a personal yet public space where writing is used as a tool for clarity, accountability, and deep thinking — especially around high-leverage engineering principles.

Most blogs are bloated, hard to navigate, or optimized for SEO, not for ROI of the reader. The goal here is to build a minimalist, _high-signal_ blog optimized for consumption and contribution by productivity-minded engineers.

---

## 🧭 Goals

- Write and publish new posts efficiently in markdown.
    
- Ensure fast, pleasant, focused reading experience for developers.
    
- Emphasize clear code formatting, visual aids (images, diagrams, YouTube embeds).
    
- Reflect your personal philosophy: **Engineer for ROI**, not output.
    
- Treat the blog itself as a minimal product — **low maintenance, high clarity**.

## 🎯 Target Audience

- You (as a writer and reflective practitioner).
    
- Software engineers seeking ways to improve how they work and think.
    
- Readers interested in productivity, engineering systems, and maximizing outcomes.

## 🧱 Functional Requirements

### ✅ Content Model

Each **Post** includes:

- `title` (string)
    
- `slug` (auto-generated from title)
    
- `datePublished` (date)
    
- `category` (optional string from a set)
    
- `content` (markdown with support for code blocks, embeds, images)
    
- `summary` (auto-excerpt or custom, shown in previews)
    
- `coverImage` (optional)
    
- `readingTime` (calculated)
    

### ✅ Categories

Predefined, tag-style categories like:

- `Productivity`
    
- `Engineering Culture`
    
- `Infra`
    
- `Architecture`
    
- `Dev Tools`
    
- `Debugging`
    
- `ROI Principles`
    

### ✅ Author

Single-author system (you), no auth required. Your personal bio and links at the bottom of each post.

## 🖼 UX/UI Principles

1. **Minimalism & Focus**
    
    - No sidebars or popups.
        
    - Content centered, max-width readable.
        
    - Subtle typography hierarchy, dark mode support.
        
2. **High Information Density**
    
    - Code blocks should support syntax highlighting and line numbers.
        
    - Embedded diagrams, videos, and images should fit naturally without crowding.
        
3. **Effortless Discoverability**
    
    - Recent posts on homepage.
        
    - Category filter (e.g., pills or tabs).
        
    - Optional search bar, fuzzy matches by title/summary.
        
4. **Snappy Performance**
    
    - Static site generation (e.g., Next.js, Astro, Hugo).
        
    - Instant loading between posts via prefetching.
        
5. **Readable on Mobile**
    
    - Fully responsive, but still dev-first in design.
        
    - Code and images should scroll horizontally, not break layout.

## 🧠 Interesting Features (Aligned with ROI Theme)

- **Reading Time Tracker** → show estimated time and optionally allow "Start timer" to track actual time spent vs. reading time.
    
- **ROI Nuggets** → TL;DR section per post with a distilled insight.
    
- **Today I Learned (TIL) mode** → A lightweight format for short-form, tweet-length insights.
    
- **Highlight & Copy Snippet** → Clickable copy buttons on code blocks.
    
- **Backlinks & Topic Graph** → Visual map of connected ideas (optional, for later).
    
- **"Last Updated" notice** → Encourages iterative writing, aligns with improving ROI over time.
    
- **GitHub Discussion/Comment Embed** → Enable reader feedback via GitHub issues or comment threads.
    
- **Focus Mode** → Toggle to remove all non-content elements (like Medium’s reader mode).

    - Markdown support: **MDX** for dynamic content (JS snippets, embeds)
        
    - Styling: **Tailwind CSS**
        
    - Deploy: **Vercel** or **Netlify**
        
    - Content in `/posts/*.mdx`, auto-imported and rendered.
        
- **Post Structure Example:**
